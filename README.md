# PERN Cubetimer Project

### Description

Single-Page interface for Rubik's Cube speedsolving.
Includes a timer and table for storing previous solve
times.

Speedsolving involves scrambling the Rubik's cube to
a random state, then trying to solve it as fast as
possible after a small inspection time, usually 15 seconds.

### Web Stack

This project will use the PERN [postgres, express, react, node] web dev tech stack.

---

### Usage

To host the backend, open a command line in the server/
directory and run:

    npm install
    node index.js

If this is successful, a port number should be returned
which can be used to access the api endpoints.

### Future Plans

In the future I plan to make several more small web
apps like this one, so this code may end up as one page
in a larger project.
